# Welcome to my project

This project serves as a stand in order managment system for subtract manufacturing

## Jacob's Notes for later:

When checking out PR's
**Create Local branch from PR and load it**

```
git fetch origin pull/19/head:pr-19
git checkout pr-19
```

Run tests..... make changes......

**Delete PR Branch**

```
git checkout master
git branch -d pr-19 (Lowercase d is safe delete, wont work if branch is not yet merged. -D (big D) is a force delete)

```
